# Music Genre Classification using Multivariate Gaussian Distribution
 
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that automatically classifies a given audio file into its respective music genre using the Bayes theoretic classifier 
with multivariate Gaussian approaches. Automatic musical genre classification can supplement or replace the human user in this process, with an accuracy of 72% for Bayes theoretic classification.
